### Full Home Based Learning Information Page

Dear Parents/Guardians,

  

During the full HBL phase, schools will provide instructions and support for students to access a range of both online and hardcopy HBL materials, so that learning continues uninterrupted. The [Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login) will continue to be accessible to students. Students who require digital devices or internet access may contact their schools for assistance. 

  

Your child/ward has been provided with instructions on how to access HBL materials by his/her teachers. He/she has also been provided a copy of the [_**Students’ Technical Guide for HBL**_](/files/2021_Students%20Technical%20Guide%20for%20HBL_website.pdf) for reference. Lessons will follow the existing timetable for your child’s/ward’s class. To manage the amount of screen time for your child/ward, the lessons may be synchronous or asynchronous, requiring online and/or offline work. The HBL lesson plan for each day will be published on the school website the day before the HBL day. Your child/ward can refer to the HBL plans for details of his/her HBL lessons for the day. Our teachers will monitor the progress of your child/ward through HBL assignments.

  

If your child/ward needs learning or emotional support, he/she can approach our teachers and other school personnel such as our allied educators and school counsellors, who will continue to work from home or from school. Our teachers will also be in regular contact with you and your child/ward. [Their contact details can be found on the school website](https://staging.d2jrpotv8emy04.amplifyapp.com/our-family/teaching-staff/). 

  

Please ensure that your child/ward stays at home during the full HBL period and continues to observe good hygiene practices such as washing his/her hands frequently with soap. If he/she feels unwell, please seek medical attention promptly and inform his/her form teacher if he/she displays any fever or flu-like symptoms. If you have any further queries, please contact Mdm Shaima, VP(Acad), or Mr Phua Cheng Peng, VP(Admin), on 65007102 and 65007103 respectively.

Thank you and keep safe!
