### Background <br> 
Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE. Primary Six (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise. 

### DSA at Fuhua Secondary School
The school is inviting applications for DSA in the following areas:

1. DSA through the school's [Applied Sciences - Forensic Science](/announcements/dsa-through-alp/)
2. DSA through [Sports: Badminton, Shooting and Tchoukball](/announcements/dsa-through-sports/)
