### Background <br> 
Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE. Primary Six (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise. 

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from Secondary 1 to 4.

### DSA at Fuhua Secondary School
The school is inviting applications for DSA in the following areas: 

1. DSA through the school's [Applied Sciences - Forensic Science](/announcements/dsa-through-alp/)
2. DSA through [Sports: Badminton, Shooting and Tchoukball](/announcements/dsa-through-sports/)
3. DSA through [Performing Arts: Choir, Concert Band and Chinese Orchestra](/announcements/dsa-through-performing-arts/)

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May. For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to the MOE website at https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec.
