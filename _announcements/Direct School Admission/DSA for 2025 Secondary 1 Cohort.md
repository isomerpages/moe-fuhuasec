<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and
talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE. Primary Six (P6) students
who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise will continue to seek admission
based on their PSLE results through the Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities
related to the talent they are selected for from Secondary 1 to 4.</p>
<p><strong>DSA at Fuhua Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>The school is inviting applications for DSA in the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) DSA through the school’s <strong>Applied Sciences - Forensic Science</strong>
</p>
<p>(2) DSA through <strong>Sports: Badminton, Shooting, Table Tennis </strong>and <strong>Tchoukball</strong>
</p>
<p>(3) DSA through <strong>Performing Arts: Choir, Concert Band</strong> and<strong> Chinese Orchestra</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated
from early-May.</p>
