### 2023 Secondary 1 Orientation

  
Our Secondary 1s participated in a fun-filled Orientation Week programme that was held from 3rd January to 7th January. Through the various activities specially planned by the seniors from the Student Leadership Board, our Secondary 1 Fuhuanites not only had the opportunity to make new friends but also learn more about the school culture and environment!   
  
The CCA orientation also gave them a glimpse of the range of CCAs offered by the school. The various CCA try-outs allowed the students to make informed decisions in their selection of a CCA.   
  
The orientation culminated with a Bestowment Ceremony, a highlight and tradition here at Fuhua! Our Secondary 1s were formally inducted into the Fuhua family in the presence of their teachers and family!   
  
**A very warm welcome to all our Secondary 1s and we wish you a fulfilling journey here in Fuhua!**
