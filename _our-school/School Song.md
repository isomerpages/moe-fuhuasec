### School Song

Keen to learn  
Eager to excel  
We work towards developing strength in body and mind  
Keeping the torch of knowledge alive in this ever-changing world  
We shall forever thrive  
  
Fuhua! Fuhua!  
Together we will strive to bring honour to your name  
Always aiming for greater heights  
We pledge to keep our school flag  
Flying high  
  
Hand in hand  
All races march  
Hope of our nation serve with one spirit, one heart, one mind  
Forward! Forward!  
To a promising and vibrant future
