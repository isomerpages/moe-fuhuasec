#### A Battle of Wits

After three years of being held virtually, the Golden Bee Challenge (金蜜蜂挑战赛) was once again held physically at the school hall on 3 March. It was a battle of wits among the representatives from all upper secondary classes. They were split into three teams where they were quizzed on their knowledge on topics such as Chinese idioms, current affairs and pop culture. There were also trivia questions about our school history and teachers in the challenge. The fierce contest concluded with Team C emerging as the champion!
