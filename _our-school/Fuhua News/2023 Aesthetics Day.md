Aesthetics Day was held on 24 May 2023, and it was a day filled with art-making activities, theatre, music, and dance performances. The programme opened with instrumental performances by students from the O-Level Music Programme and Music Elective Programme. Then, it was time for the students to let their creative juices flow and head to their classrooms to carry out their art challenges in teams. As we returned to the hall, we were presented with a play titled “The Lord of the Flies” by Drama Arts.

The next segment was Talent Quest, where 4 groups of students performed on the big stage in hopes to win the talent competition of the year. We had 3 guest judges who gave their feedback after each performance, and all the students got to vote for the winner of their choice too. Everyone was also treated to performances put by the students who participated in the Pop Vocals and Hip Hop NAC workshops.

At the end of the programme, prizes and awards were given out for the Art Challenges and Talent Quest. 

**Congratulations to all prize winners!**
