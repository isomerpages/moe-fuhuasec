Yang kurik itu kundi;<br>
Yang merah itu saga;<br>
Yang baik itu budi;<br>
Yang indah itu bahasa

The spotted are the kundi seeds,Â <br>
the reds are the saga seeds<br>
Manners maketh the man

What you have just read is a popular Malay pantoum or better known to Malay language speakers as Pantun. Pantun originated in the Malay archipelago as a short folk poem, typically made up of two rhyming couplets that were recited or sung. Nowadays, it is usually used in events as an opening or closing statement or in special occasions such as marriage ceremonies.

To make such beautiful poetry live on, Fuhuanites were invited to Pesta Pantun again this year. It is heartening to see everyone working together, shoulder to shoulder, to create pantun. 

Congratulations to all the winning groups who had valiantly taken up the challenge of replying to their teachers' pantun, in a beautiful and creative way!
