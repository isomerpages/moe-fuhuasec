#### Ushering in the Year of the Rabbit 

The celebration of the Year of the Rabbit sprang back in full force this year! The MTL department organised a live Chinese New Year concert, which provided a platform for different performing arts groups and students to showcase their talents.

The school was dazzled by the performances put up by Chinese Dance & Wushu, Malay Cultural Society, Chinese Orchestra and the Concert Band. We were even treated to a meaningful song titled “*Moonlight in The City*” 《城里的月光》, performed by a group of Secondary 2 students, to celebrate our reunion in a live concert after 2 years. The MTL department also invited alumni to perform a cross talk performance titled “*New Year*”《论过年》as part of the celebration. Some highlights of the concert are the lion dance performance and distribution of candies by the God of Fortune. 

All in all, it was a morning filled with joyous celebrations to welcome the new year!
