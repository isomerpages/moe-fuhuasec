<p>Marking the start of their journey in Fuhua, our Secondary 1 students
participated in a fun-filled Orientation Week programme from 2 to 5 January
2024.</p>
<p>The orientation was designed to welcome and familiarise the students to
the school culture and environment and to provide bonding opportunities
and foster a sense of belonging to the school and their form class. The
orientation segments were designed to develop the six domains of Character
Strengths in our students. These included activities for students to learn
what it meant to be a Fuhuanite, get to know their form teachers, orientation
seniors, student mentors and peers and to design their classroom to be
uniquely theirs. Through the programme, they were also provided the necessary
guidance and support they need as they make the transition to secondary
school, a school amazing race and CCA Orientation to give them a glimpse
of the wide range of CCAs we offer.</p>
<p>The week-long programme culminated in the Orientation Camp Fire, with
each class presenting their class cheers and school cheer.</p>
<p>A BIG AND WARM WELCOME TO ALL SECONDARY 1 STUDENTS!</p>
