### Lunch Tunes 2022

Lunch Tunes 2022 was a success! Despite the pandemic and its constraints, Fuhuanites were eager to participate and showcase their musical talents in the annual arts event, organised by the Aesthetics Development Committee. While not all who registered were eventually featured, we hope that all Fuhuanites will continue to pursue their dream of performing and bringing joy to those around them through their talents. 

  

This year, there were a total of 8 performances, showcasing singing, dancing as well as drumming! We also had a special collaboration between a graduating student and a teacher! 

  

The school would like to acknowledge the efforts of all who registered and participated in Lunch Tunes 2022.
