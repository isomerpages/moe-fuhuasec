#### Enriching OUR Fuhuanites' Sporting Experience

On 9th March, the Sec 4 and 5 students attended the Sec 4 and 5 Sports Enrichment Programme (SEP) organised by Fuhua's PE Department. SEP was introduced by the PE department to allow students to experience a sport which they may not have the opportunity to learn during PE lessons to develop their interest and enrich their sporting experience.

The students were feeling excited as they reported to the hall in the morning in their sports attire. After the morning assembly and briefing by Mr Paul Chandra, the HOD PE, the students assembled into their respective sports groups. The sports programmes available that day include archery, bowling, fencing, rollerblading, and rock climbing.

For archery, the students were taught basic archery techniques and they had to strategise with their teammates against other groups. Â For bowling, the students travelled to Singapore Poly Graduate Guild to learn basic bowling skills. For fencing, the students were taught how to spar using foam swords and they had a competition. For rollerblading, the students learnt how to skate around obstacles and even skating backwards. For rock climbing, the students travelled to Ground Up, a climbing gym and enjoyed a session of rock climbing and bouldering.
