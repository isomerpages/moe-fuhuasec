### World Robot Olympiad 2020

  
The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Canada 2020-X was held this year from 12 - 15 November 2020.  
  
Two teams from our school's Robotics Club took part in this event. They are:  
  
Team Aegis - Eng Peng Gin (3S1), Ng Wee Herng (3S2) and Ong Chee Yu (3S9)  
Team Clutch Jr. - Glenn Wu (3S2), Tai Ka Keane (3S2) and Chong Qi Yuan (3S3)  
  
Despite being held online and the 13-hour time difference, our Fuhuanites have done us proud! Our teams clinched the 1st and 3rd place in the Regular Challenge Junior Category and 1st and 8th place in the Surprise Challenge Junior Category!&nbsp;  
  
Congratulations Fuhuanites!
