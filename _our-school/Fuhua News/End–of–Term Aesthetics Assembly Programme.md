### End-of-Term Aesthetics Assembly Programme!

Fuhuanites were ecstatic to be able to assemble as a whole school to end Semester 1 with a bang! 

The school was introduced to the various beats in jazz and Latin music by a talented jazz band led by lead vocalist Matilda D'Silva! Our Fuhuanites thoroughly enjoyed themselves as they grooved to the songs played by the band. There was an electric atmosphere in the school hall as the band brought us through catchy songs such as _Matilda_ to a soulful rendition of local-favourite _Home._ Our innovative Fuhuanites even amped up the atmosphere by sending their love to the band via their Personal Learning Devices. It was such a heart-warming sight to see Fuhuanites enjoying themselves with their teachers and friends! 

We are certainly grateful for the opportunity and look forward to more assemblies in the future!
