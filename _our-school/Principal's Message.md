### Principal's Message

Welcome to the Fuhua Secondary School website!
<br> 
<br> The school was established in 1999 and received her first students in 2000. Under the leadership of the founding principal, Mr Ong Kian Choon, and the collective wisdom of the successive school leaders, Fuhua Secondary School has developed into a school of choice. Today, this pioneering spirit continues to drive the school to innovate with distinctive programmes and create a quality curriculum to support the aspirations of Fuhuanites. &nbsp;

As the fifth Principal of the school, I look forward to working in synergy with my Vice Principals and Staff to build on the success and legacy of our esteemed predecessors. There is a strong culture of excellence and collaboration that drives the school’s mission to be a _Premier School, Serving Community._ The School’s RISE Values of Respect, Integrity, Service and Excellence are the basis on which Fuhuanites are holistically nurtured so that they are Passionate Learners, Confident Communicators, and Innovative Problem Solvers and Leaders. There are many opportunities created by caring staff and committed partners to help Fuhuanites to acquire a deeper understanding of their strengths and grow wider perspectives about our complex and fascinating world.

Charles Darwin noted that in nature, it is neither the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but one who is most responsive to change. We need to be able to connect seemingly separate dots and create knowledge, even as society changes and appears to have many contradictions. To help Fuhuanites recognise opportunities and thrive, we want them to develop sound character, discernment in decision-making and an attitude to always Strive for Excellence. In these ways, the Fuhuanites can confidently face a rapidly transforming future of learning, working, and living.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Education is a people growing business. We have the power to touch lives and make magical changes happen through learning. If the ability to learn and learn collaboratively have such power for lifelong success, we hope to make this a gift for every Fuhuanite to treasure.

Mrs Carol Lim<br>Principal <br> Fuhua Secondary School
