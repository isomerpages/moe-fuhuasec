### Principal's Message

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:203px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> 2023 sees Fuhua Secondary on the cusp of her next significant milestone. She celebrates her Silver Jubilee in 2024. To reinforce the milestone, the school will continue to strengthen the rebars that are in the core of the milestone. The primary function of rebars is to lend the structures, they are found in, greater tensile strength, greater resilience. The steadfastness and determination that Fuhuanites have exemplified in their strive for excellence against a backdrop of challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic bear testimony to the resilience the school aspires to imbue in her students. In 2023, the school will continue her efforts through her distinctive, core and co-curricular programmes to nurture resilient Fuhuanites who will **learn for life** and **thrive in life.**

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Forensic Science@Fuhua curriculum will be augmented with enhanced lessons on machine learning as well as the inclusion of the study of Internet of Things. This is to help equip students with the fundamental knowledge that will allow them to, in the near future, better appreciate the Internet of Everything concepts, components and technologies as well as the implementation challenges and security concerns.

The Learning for Life Programme will see the return of overseas learning journeys to continue its focus on nurturing Fuhuanites’ global and cultural literacies. And with the resumption of the outdoor adventure learning activities which include the residential cohort camp for the Secondary 1 and the Secondary 3 cohorts, Fuhuanites will have the opportunity to develop physical and emotional ruggedness as well as to learn the importance of caring and looking out for fellow members of a community. With doing good for immediate family members or close circle of friends remaining the fundamental premise of the Student Initiated Learning (SIL) component of Blended Learning, the school aims to, together with the staples such as values in action programmes and student leadership programmes, realise her vision of nurturing a caring community of Fuhuanites who will serve with purpose and mission now and beyond.

The Personal Learning Device initiative will focus on strengthening Fuhuanites’ new media literacies - curate digital content and information; create digital multimodal products and connect and communicate digitally. This is to augment the delivery of the intended outcome of the initiative - to nurture self-directed, connected and responsible digital learners.

To respond to the call by the Ministry of Education to schools to be eco stewards, the school has pledged to work in synergy with the Green Innovation Centre (GIC) established by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce Singapore to support the realisation of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Fuhuanites will contribute as best as they can to the GIC Cozy Garden@ Bukit Batok initiative which will be launched in 2023.

The delivery of the mainstay curricular programmes will continue to focus on developing Fuhuanites into Passionate Learners, Innovative Problem-Solvers, Confident Communicators and Servant Leaders. This will allow Fuhuanites to not only be ready for the future but to lead the future.

At this point I would like to express my deepest appreciation to the teachers and administrative staff for the time and energy that they will be unreservedly investing to make 2023 a meaningful and enriching year for all Fuhuanites.

I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to the Fuhua School Advisory Committee, the Parent Support Group and the alumni for their continued unwavering support in 2023.

May 2023 be a most rewarding and fruitful year for all in the Fuhua family as she looks forward to celebrating her Silver Jubilee in 2024!
