### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

**Vision**
<br> Fuhuanites who are confident and passionate about leading self and others to serve the larger community

**Mission**
<br> To equip students with leadership skills and provide service learning opportunities for them to engage and make a difference to the world

**Approach**
<br> Fuhua’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is in the area of Community Youth Leadership. There are three tiers to distinguish the various groups of students and the respective programmes for development. At the core of the programme is Leadership and the Design Thinking Process which form the foundation for all Values-in-Action (VIA) projects.

* Tier 1: Recognises that every student is a leader – Design Thinking principles form the backdrop of all level-wide VIA projects
* Tier 2: Distinguishes the positional leaders – The school partners external organisations to provide them with additional training through workshops and camps.
* Tier 3: Identifies students who possess a keen interest to initiate and lead in community VIA and provides them the support, mentorship and link-up with relevant Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWO) locally or overseas.    

**Key Programmes**

**Cohort leadership programme**
<br> At lower secondary, all students are introduced to the Design Thinking process and apply their knowledge through various level-wide VIA projects

**Leadership programmes for positional leaders**
<br> Prefects, Sports Leaders, Co-Curricular Activities Leaders and Class Leaders participate in leadership programmes such as in-house workshops, camps. The school also works with external organisations such as Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and ActiveSG to provide students with additional opportunities to further develop their skills and competencies. Learning is applied through leading camps, school events and community VIA programmes.

**‘Leadership Through Service’ VIA**
<br> Students who have a keen interest in community service are encouraged to self-initiate VIA projects. The school supports them by linking them up with VWOs, and working with them to develop skills and attributes to lead in community VIA. At Secondary 3, students are given the opportunity to participate in an overseas service learning experience.
