### Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

**Aim**<br>
* To enable Fuhuanites to connect academic knowledge with the real world through experiential learning 
* To build their analytical skills through the scientific method


**Approach**
<br> The ALP curriculum will be organised and designed around 4 key learning experiences:
<br>
* **Engagement** - students to consider what evidence is present. 
* **Exploration** - students research and learn about a self-determined aspect of the topic.
* **Experimentation** â€“ students conduct experiments, collect data and interpret findings. 
* **Evaluation** and iteration - students to relate findings and data to the crime.
    
**Programme Structure**

**Core Programme**
<br> All lower secondary students undergo a one-year programme which focuses on inculcating scientific thinking skills through the delivery of lessons built on teaching various forensic techniques used in crime scene investigation. All lessons are designed to include hands-on activities that engage the students and promote scientific thinking.

**Elective Programme**
<br>
Modules on specialised forensic techniques (e.g. digital forensics) are offered to selected students with a deep interest in forensic science for them to acquire knowledge and skills beyond the&nbsp;Core Programmme.
