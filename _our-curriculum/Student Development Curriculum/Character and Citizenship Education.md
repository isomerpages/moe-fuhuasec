### Character and Citizenship Education

**Vision**
<br> Students of character who have compassion and are ready to serve

**Mission**
<br> To provide platforms for Fuhuanites to develop good character, and champion social causes for the betterment of the larger community

**Approach**
<br> The approach to the teaching and learning in CCE involves:

1\.  Alignment of CCE framework with school values – Respect, Integrity, Service & Excellence – to guide students' attitude and actions  
2\.  Development of students' character through Moral knowing, Moral feeling and Moral doing, which is girded by Thomas Lickona's Theory of Character Education  
3\.  Whole-school approach to inculcating core values and skills through formal curriculum and experiential programmes  
4\. Development of empathy in Values-in-Action (VIA) through the Design Thinking approach  
 
**Key Programmes**
**1\. Foundation Programme**
<br> Foundation Programme aims to inculcate core values and skills through multiple platforms at the school-wide level including Instructional Programmes, CCE lessons, Form Teacher periods, National Education, Values-in-Action, Sexuality Education, Education and Career Guidance Programme and other level-based programmes.

**2\. Experiential Programme**
<br> The Experiential Programme aims to inculcate core values and skills through hands-on learning opportunities such as CCA, VIA, and local and overseas camps.   

**3\. Design Thinking in VIA**
<br> Lower Secondary students undergo a series of Design Thinking in VIA lessons, build empathy, and eventually advocate for their ideas at Champion a Cause Day in Secondary 2. At Secondary 3, students embark on a class-initiated VIA for a client group or a community need using Design Thinking.
