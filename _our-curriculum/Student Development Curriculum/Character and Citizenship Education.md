<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Students of character who have compassion and are ready to serve</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To provide platforms for Fuhuanites to develop good character, and champion
social causes for the betterment of the larger community</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
<br>The approach to the teaching and learning in CCE involves:</p>
<p>1. Alignment of CCE framework with school values – Respect, Integrity,
Service &amp; Excellence – to guide students' attitude and actions
<br>2. Development of students' character through Moral knowing, Moral feeling
and Moral doing, which is girded by Thomas Lickona's Theory of Character
Education
<br>3. Whole-school approach to inculcating core values and skills through
formal curriculum and experiential programmes
<br>4. Development of empathy in Values-in-Action (VIA) through the Design
Thinking approach</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
<br><strong>(1) Foundation Programme</strong>
<br>Foundation Programme&nbsp;aims to inculcate core values and skills through
multiple platforms at the school-wide level including Instructional Programmes,
CCE lessons, Form Teacher periods, National Education, Values-in-Action,
Sexuality Education, Education and Career Guidance Programme and other
level-based programmes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>(2) Experiential Programme</strong>
<br>The Experiential Programme aims to inculcate core values and skills through
hands-on learning opportunities such as CCA, VIA, local camps and Beyond
Borders Overseas Service Learning experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(3) Design Thinking in VIA</strong>
<br>Lower Secondary students undergo a series of Design Thinking in VIA lessons,
build empathy, and eventually advocate for their ideas at Champion a Cause
Day in Secondary 2. At Secondary 3, students embark on a class-initiated
VIA for a client group or a community need using Design Thinking.</p>
