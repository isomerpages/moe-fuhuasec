### Character and Citizenship Education

##### Vision

Students of character who have compassion and are ready to serve

  

##### Mission

To provide platforms for Fuhuanites to develop good character, and champion social causes for the betterment of the larger community

##### Approach

The approach to the teaching and learning in CCE involves:

1\.  Alignment of CCE framework with school values – Respect, Integrity, Service & Excellence – to guide students' attitude and actions  
    
2\.  Development of students' character through Moral knowing, Moral feeling and Moral doing, which is girded by Thomas Lickona's Theory of Character Education  
    
3\.  Whole-school approach to inculcating core values and skills through formal curriculum and experiential programmes  
    
4.  Development of empathy in Values-in-Action (VIA) through the Design Thinking approach  
    

#### Key Programmes

_Design Thinking in VIA_

_Design Thinking in VIA_ Lower Secondary students undergo a series of Design Thinking in VIA lessons, build empathy, and eventually advocate for their ideas at Champion a Cause Day in Secondary 2. At Secondary 3, students embark on a class-initiated VIA for a client group or a community need using Design Thinking.
