<h3>Co-curricular Activities Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Passionate and holistically developed Fuhuanites leading balanced lives</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To develop students’ talents to their fullest potential while cultivating
upstanding character</p>
<p>The Co-curricular Activities (CCA) Programme provides Fuhuanites with
a platform to discover their interests, talents and to strive for excellence.
It aims to ignite in Fuhuanites a lifelong love for a particular activity,
allowing them to lead a balanced life in adulthood. Through active participation
in CCAs, Fuhuanites strengthen the cultivation of school values of Respect,
Integrity, Service and Excellence while developing friendships and collaborating
with other Fuhuanites.</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>In planning and implementing our CCA programmes, it is ensured that there
is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Breadth of experiences that support students’ holistic development
and expand their learning
<br>2. Development and progression in the learning experiences that deepen
students’ knowledge, skills and values
<br>3. Balance between individual pursuit of excellence and collaboration
that allow for participation by all students
<br>4. Social bonding and integration which present opportunities for friendships
and teamwork</p>
<p>The specific knowledge, skills and values developed depends on the choice
of CCA. There are four broad clusters of CCAs: <a href="/co-curricular-activities/clubs-and-societies/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clubs and Societies</a>,
