<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Play in Action</strong>
<br>Play in Action imparts skills and knowledge of a range of sports across
the three categories of invasion, net barrier and striking-and-fielding.
This serves to introduce students to different sports for them to discover
their interests and enable them to develop the habit of participating in
sports. The department organises an Inter-Class Games for every level where
students experience and apply their learning at a competitive platform
and display values such as sportsmanship, teamwork and excellence.</p>
<p><strong>2. Body in Motion</strong>
<br>Body in Motion builds students’ fitness level, increases their nutritional
knowledge and cultivates habits towards a healthy lifestyle. The ReAction
Programme provides additional support for some students. Partnering Active
SG, identified students take part in physical activities and other fun
sports outside school with guidance from certified fitness instructors
to encourage them to continue to engage in physical activities after they
graduate.</p>
<p><strong>3. Outdoor Education</strong>
<br>Students are taught different outdoor and life skills at various levels
in three broad areas: Camp Craft, Shelter Building, Orienteering, Risk
Assessment and Management. Students are then given opportunities during
their Secondary 1 “Beyond Your Comfort Zone” Outdoor Adventure Learning
Camp to apply their skills and knowledge for the outdoors, build their
resilience to face adverse situations and develop a sense of ruggedness.
Their skills are further extended either during their Outward Bound School
(OBS) Camp or &nbsp;in their Secondary 3 “Redefine Your Comfort Zone” Outdoor
Adventure Learning Camp.</p>
<p><strong>4. Sports Enrichment Programme (SEP) </strong>
<br>The SEP is organised for Secondary 2 and graduating students to expose
and enrich them in sports not taught in the PE curriculum. The programme
provides&nbsp; students with the opportunity to learn a new sports, encourage
active participation and instill their interest in picking up a sport beyond
their secondary school years.</p>
