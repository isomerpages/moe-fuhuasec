  * Imparting of values and life skills such as resilience, ruggedness and teamwork
  * Building of competency in assessing and managing risk in authentic outdoor settings
  * Developing of an appreciation of the outdoors and a sense of place


**Key Programmes**

**1\. Play in Action**
<br> Play in Action imparts skills and knowledge of a range of sports across the three categories of invasion, net barrier and striking-and-fielding. This serves to introduce students to different sports for them to discover their interests and enable them to develop the habit of participating in sports. The department organises an inter-class Sports Carnival where students experience and apply their learning at a competitive platform and display values such as sportsmanship, teamwork and excellence.

**2\. Body in Motion**
<br> Body in Motion builds students' fitness level, increases their nutritional knowledge and cultivates habits towards a healthy lifestyle. The ReAction Programme provides additional support for some students. Partnering Active SG, identified students take part in physical activities outside school with guidance from certified fitness instructors. The department also works with Health Promotion Board to organise enriching exercise classes such as piloxing, Tabata training and other fun sports to introduce and encourage students to continue to engage in physical activities after they graduate.

**3\. Outdoor Education**

Students are taught different outdoor and life skills at various levels in three broad areas: Camp Craft, Orienteering, Risk Assessment and Management. Students are then given opportunities during their Secondary 2 "Beyond Comfort Zone" Outdoor Adventure Camp to apply their skills and knowledge for the outdoors, build their resilience to face adverse situations and develop a sense of ruggedness. Their skills are further extended during the Outward Bound School (OBS) Camp in Secondary 3.
