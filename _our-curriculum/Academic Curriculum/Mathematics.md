<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Fuhuanites: Problem Solvers for the 21st Century</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>&nbsp;
<br>To nurture Fuhuanites who are able to think practically, critically and
systematically</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
<br>The department adopts a Practical-Critical-Systematic approach to the
teaching and learning of Mathematics:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Practical – Applying Mathematics in real-world contexts to make sense
of and solve everyday problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical – Exercising sound reasoning in decision-making and using metacognitive
skills to monitor and refine one’s thinking;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systematic – Developing computational thinking skills and inculcating
heuristics to solve problems algorithmically and systematically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
<br>The Mathematics Department nurtures Fuhuanites to be critical, adaptive
and inventive thinkers. Students are given opportunities to appreciate
the beauty, power and relevance of Mathematics through authentic problem
solving in real-world contexts. Through the Mathematics curriculum, the
department aims to cultivate curiosity, deep conceptual understanding,
and the joy of learning, while helping students see how Mathematics connects
to the world around them.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong>
<br>The Talent Development Programme supports selected students in harnessing
their passion for Mathematics and honing their higher-order thinking and
reasoning skills through deeper exploration and challenge. Students have
access to enrichment opportunities that extend their learning beyond the
classroom. These include participation in competitions such as the Singapore
Mathematical Olympiad, the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, and
the NIE Mathematics Challenge, where students apply problem-solving heuristics
to solve higher-order thinking questions.</p>
