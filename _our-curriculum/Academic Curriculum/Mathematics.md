### Mathematics

**Vision**<br>
Fuhuanites: Problem Solvers for the 21st Century

**Mission**&nbsp;<br>
To nurture Fuhuanites who are able to think practically, critically and systematically

**Approach**<br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of Mathematics involves:

1\.  (PRACTICAL) Engaging students with problems in a real-world context, with a focus on Financial Literacy;      
2\.  (CRITICAL) Inculcating in students the heuristics for solving problems as well as metacognition to reflect on their solutions; and     
3\.  (SYSTEMATIC) Cultivating in students the ability to think algorithmically and explain clearly  

**Key Programmes**&nbsp;

OUR students have the opportunities to learn Mathematics in an engaging and fun way, and apply Mathematics knowledge in solving problems in the real-world contexts. Some of the programmes include treasure hunt,&nbsp;Math trails and learning journeys.

**1\.Infinity+**
<br>
Infinity+, a talent development programme offered by the department, provides opportunities for students who have shown interest and/or talent in Mathematics. The heart of Mathematics education in Singapore is Problem Solving and through our Infinity+ programs, we focus on teaching students to apply problem solving heuristics to solve higher-order thinking questions.
