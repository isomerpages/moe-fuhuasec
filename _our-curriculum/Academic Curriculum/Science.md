### Science

**Vision**<br>
Inquisitive Learners, Creative Problem Solvers

**Mission**<br>
To ignite the passion for learning; to develop inquiring and creative minds

**Approach**<br>
The department deploys the MAKE - LEARN - THINK Science Curriculum Framework to provide quality teaching and learning to enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.&nbsp;

**Key Programmes**

**1\. Science as an inquiry**

Using scientific inquiry to strengthen the joy of learning, emphasize relevance of science, and develop capabilities to innovate solutions and create larger good.

**2\. Leverage e-pedagogies and the SLS pedagogical scaffold**

To design engaging learning experiences that promotes collaboration and create meaningful assessments that provide data for consideration.

**FORENSIC SCIENCE @ FUHUA**

The ALP curriculum aims to strengthen the development of 21st century competencies through an interdisciplinary approach is organised and designed around four key learning experiences:

1\. Engagement - students to consider evidences presented through a hypothetical crime scenario.

2\.  Exploration - students research and learn about a self-determined aspect of the topic.
    
3\.  Experimentation â€“ students conduct experiments, collect data and interpret findings.&nbsp;
    
4\.  Evaluation and iteration - students to relate findings and data to the crime.

**INSPIRE**

INSPIRE is the Science talent development programme for students who have demonstrated strong aptitude and interest in Science, to deepen their passion and talent in Science.&nbsp;

The programme aims to:

* further develop the skills and abilities of students talented in science by providing an environment where students can work with peers who share similar aspirations;
    
* develop an appreciation, knowledge and understanding of techniques and skills in scientific study and research methodologies; and
    
* build 21st century competencies such as Critical and Inventive Thinking and Communication and Collaboration skills.

There are three tiers in INSPIRE:&nbsp;

* Tier 1 - Interest-based modules in partnership with external agencies e.g. Science Centre and the polytechnics
* Tier 2 - Academic-based modules for selected students such as Junior Olympiads training
* Tier 3 - Student-initiated modules to deepen students' interest in science and appreciate the application of science
