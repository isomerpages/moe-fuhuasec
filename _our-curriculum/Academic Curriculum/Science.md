### Science

**Vision**<br>
Inquisitive Learners, Creative Problem Solvers

**Mission**<br>
To ignite the passion for learning; to develop inquiring and creative minds

**Approach**<br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of Science involves:

1\.  Implementation of inquiry-based instruction to develop critical science inquiry skills and engage students' mind  
    
2\.  Infusion of metacognitive processes to develop independent thinkers and self-directed learners  
    
3\.  Contextualised learning to provide opportunities for students to apply their scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems  
    
**Key Programmes**

**1\.INSPIRE**

INSPIRE allows students to achieve multiple spires of excellence in the area of Science. The programme aims to:

* further develop the skills and abilities of students talented in science by providing an environment where students can work with peers who share similar aspirations;  
    
* develop an appreciation, knowledge and understanding of techniques and skills in scientific study and research methodologies; and  
    
* build 21st century competencies such as Critical and Inventive Thinking and Communication and Collaboration skills.  

There are three tiers in INSPIRE: 

Tier 1 - Interest-based modules in partnership with external agencies e.g. Science Centre and the polytechnics

Tier 2 - Academic-based modules for selected students such as Junior Olympiads training

Tier 3 - Student-initiated modules to deepen students' interest in science and appreciate the application of science

**2\. Science Enrichment Programme**

The Science Enrichment Programme aims to provide a vibrant science learning environment with impactful learning experiences targeting the different learning needs and interests of students. It provides students with the opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation of their environment and the role of science in their everyday life and widen their knowledge of science beyond the textbook. The programme includes learning journeys and interest-based workshops (in areas such as Food Science, Forensic Science and Engineering Science) for all students.
