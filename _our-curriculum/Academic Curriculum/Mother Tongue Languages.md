### Mother Tongue Languages

**Vision**<br>
Fuhuanites: Active Learners and Proficient Users of Mother Tongue Language
  
**Mission**<br>
To instil in Fuhuanites the love for the Mother Tongue language and culture, and to develop proficient and effective communicators

**Approach**
<br>The approach to the teaching and learning of Mother Tongue Languages involves:

1\.  Strengthening communication skills of our younger generation  
    
2\.  Promoting the awareness and appreciation of our cultural roots  

**Key Programmes**<br>

**1\. Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight Programme**
<br> Mother Tongue Language Fortnight aims to create a conducive environment to promote the use and learning of MTL beyond the classroom and school. Every year, a variety of activities related to MTL language and culture are organised for our Fuhuanites. Activities include cultural camp, learning journey, workshop, competitions. These activities provide platforms for Fuhuanites to learn MTL and their culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’.

**2\. Signature Programme - Reading**
<br> The reading programme aims to cultivate the habit of reading Mother Tongue Languages books in Fuhuanites to strengthen their language proficiency. CL Happy Readers 悦读@辅华 includes teaching of translation skills with reading while ML READRAMA includes script writing and drama acting with reading.
