**Mission**<br>
To instil in Fuhuanites the love for the Mother Tongue language and culture, and to develop proficient and effective communicators

**Approach**
<br>The approach to the teaching and learning of Mother Tongue Languages involves:

2\.  Promoting the awareness and appreciation of our cultural roots  

**Key Programmes**<Br>

**1\. Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight Programme**
<br> MT Fortnight aims to enable students to appreciate their Mother Tongue and culture.  All students taking Chinese Language (CL) and Malay Language will be involved in a series of activities such as cultural workshops, competitions and learning journeys.

**2\. Chinese Cultural Immersion Programme**
<br> All Secondary 1 and 2 Express students taking Higher CL/CL will be offered this programme. It is a school-based enrichment programme where students learn about the history and development of traditional Chinese culture such as costumes, cuisines, architecture, Chinese medicine, wedding ceremonies etc.

**3\. 3-minute speech**

Based on a topic given, students prepare a 3-minute speech to be presented in class. This activity provides a platform for all students to express themselves clearly and confidently. Teachers’ feedback and peers' critique which are given aim to help the students improve and become better communicators.
