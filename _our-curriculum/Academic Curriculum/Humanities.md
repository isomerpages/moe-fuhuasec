<h3>Humanities</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Concerned and contributing citizens who are global in outlook and rooted
to Singapore</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To develop empathetic, passionate and thoughtful Fuhuanites who contribute
positively to society</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
<br>The approach to the teaching and learning of Humanities involves:</p>
<p>1. Promoting authentic and experiential learning;
<br>2. Developing analytical and critical thinking through inquiry; and
<br>3. Strengthening disciplinary thinking</p>
<p><strong>Key programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(1) Inquiry-based Learning</strong>
<br>The department promotes inquiry-based learning in our students through
learning experiences. Through these face-to-face and interactive learning
experiences, students work collaboratively and can develop their analytical
and critical thinking skills. They are also introduced to data and information
skills, which include the collection, analysis and representation of data.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Talent Development Programme</strong>
<br>The Humanities talent development programme aims to strengthen disciplinary
thinking among talented Fuhuanites. It provides opportunities for students
to develop a greater interest and passion for the Humanities beyond what
is taught in the classroom. This is done through internal school programmes
and external competitions such as:</p>
