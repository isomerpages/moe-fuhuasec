### Humanities

**Vision**<br>
Concerned and contributing citizens who are global in outlook and rooted to Singapore

**Mission**<br>
To develop empathetic, passionate and thoughtful Fuhuanites who contribute positively to society

**Approach**<br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of Humanities involves:

1\.  Promoting authentic and experiential learning;  
2\.  Developing analytical and critical thinking through inquiry; and  
3\.  Strengthening disciplinary thinking  
    

**Key programmes**

**1\.Inquiry-based Learning through Learning Packages** <br> The department promotes inquiry-based learning in our students&nbsp; through the Geographical/ Historical/ Social Studies Investigations. Through these face-to-face and interactive learning packages/ trails, students work collaboratively and can develop their analytical and critical thinking skills. They are also introduced to data and information skills, which include the collection, analysis and representation of data. 

Some of the learning packages/ trails this year include:

*   Sec 1 GI on the Bukit Batok Nature Reserve
*   Sec 2 HI on the Maria Hertogh riots
*   Sec 3 GI on Sustainability and urban neighbourhoods
*   Sec 3 HI on Nazi Germany
*   Sec 3 SS II on Citizenship and governance

**2\.Illuminate**<br>
Illuminate is the Humanities talent development programme which aims to strengthen disciplinary thinking among talented Fuhuanites. It provides opportunities for students to develop a greater interest and passion for the Humanities beyond what is taught in the classroom. This is done through internal school programmes and external competitions, as well as the Humanities Week.

(i) Humanities Week
<br>
2023’s inaugural Humanities Week was “Staying Rooted, Thinking Global”. Experiential and hands-on programmes were planned for all levels of the school, such as the Sec 1 “Through space and time: A quest for knowledge” learning activities, Sec 2 "Through our Eyes" Photo competition, Sec 3 LJs to Maritime Port Authority and HEMA workshop, and the Humanities assembly programme. This week-long programme helped to highlight the relevance of the Humanities in our Fuhuanites’ daily lives as well as inculcate in them the joy of learning Humanities.

(ii) External Competitions
<br>
Students also have the opportunity to take part in external competitions such as:

* NUS Geography Challenge
* MOE History Challenge
* NLB Historical Scene Investigation
* NP Social Innovation Hackathon
