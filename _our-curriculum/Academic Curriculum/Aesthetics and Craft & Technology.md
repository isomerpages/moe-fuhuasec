### Aesthetics and Craft & Technology

**Vision**

Creative and enterprising Fuhuanites who appreciate the arts

  
**Mission** <br>
To unleash the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Fuhuanites through the arts


**Approach**<br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of Aesthetics and Craft & Technology subjects involves infusing and translating concepts and theories that the students learn during lessons into new design ideas and projects.

*   Art & Music: Promote artistic experimentation, expression and discovery to strengthen students’ experience  
    
*   Design & Technology: Design new solutions based on the identified user needs  
    
*   Nutrition & Food Science: Design food concepts centring on menu development, nutrition, cooking techniques and aesthetic presentation  
    


**Key Programmes**


_3X-Print (eXplore, eXperiment & eXpress)_

_3X-Print_ aims to inculcate in students the attitude of inquiry through the exposure of various printmaking techniques. This programme is a platform for students to explore different possibilities in their art-making processes. The programme aims to encourage them to take risks and innovate while expressing themselves artistically.



_Design For A Cause_


This programme is designed to equip students with design thinking skills to empathise the critical needs of identified groups. Students are taught to define the groups' situations accurately and ideate solutions to address their needs. Their ideas are conceptualised through mock-ups and model-making through 3-D printing.



_Sing & Strum_

All lower secondary students will go through the fundamental guitar-playing course. Students learn by playing pop songs, allowing for the joy of learning as it is the preferred genre among teenagers. Some of them enhance their learning by furthering their musical journey through music improvisation or composition.


_Farm To Plate_

_Farm To Plate_ aims to enrich and raise awareness among students on the wide range of local produce. To encourage parental involvement, the department organises a culinary session "Our Date with Dad" for fathers to join their children in cooking. This programme enriches students' learning, expose them to local produce while enjoying the bonding experience with their fathers.

  

_2021 Achievements_

**Food And Beverage Entrepreneurship Competition 2021**

This competition is organised by Republic Polytechnic's (RP) School of Hospitality. The team, consisting of  Kenneth Tan Kai Xuan and Wayne Soh Kai from Class 3S7, clinched the Overall Champion this year.

  

The competition provided our students with the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity, problem-solving skills and presentation skills in front of a panel of hospitality industry leaders. Responding to the competition theme “Towards innovative and healthier Singaporean cuisine”, our students re-created local dishes that will appeal to the current and future population in terms of flavour, nutrition, therapeutic properties, texture and presentation.

**Cluster West 7 Upload! Online Art Competition 2021**                                                                                  

Our inaugural W7 Upload! Online Art Competition 2021 which was held between the period of 23 Aug and 24 Sep 2021 for students of W7 Cluster Schools. This art competition was organised for our students to share their passion and showcase their talents on the virtual and online platform. 

  

The theme for this year is “The New Normal”. Besides allowing students to hone their creativity, art skills and boost their confidence as blooming young artists, it was also an eye-opening opportunity for them to see how peers from other schools express themselves through the art pieces created on a common theme.
