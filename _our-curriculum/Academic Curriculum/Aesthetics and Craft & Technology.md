### Aesthetics and Craft &amp; Technology

**Vision**

Creative and enterprising Fuhuanites who appreciate the arts

**Mission** <br>
To unleash the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Fuhuanites through the arts

**Approach**<br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of Aesthetics and Craft &amp; Technology subjects involves infusing and translating concepts and theories that the students learn during lessons into new design ideas and projects.

* Art &amp; Music: Promote artistic experimentation, expression and discovery to strengthen students’ experience  
    
* Design &amp; Technology: Design new solutions based on the identified user needs  
    
* Nutrition &amp; Food Science: Design food concepts centering on menu development, nutrition, cooking techniques and aesthetic presentation  
    
**Key Programmes**

**Interdisciplinary Innovation Challenge**<br> The Aesthetics, Craft and Technology Department aims to create an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for students where they work collaboratively in teams to develop innovative solutions to a challenge set in a prescribed theme.

The collaborative tasks assigned through each unit include:
* Art - Food Mascot GIFs Character
* Design &amp; Technology - Ambient Light Fixture
* Food &amp; Consumer Education - Creative Muffins
* Music - Jingles Composition

Students are given opportunities to present their ideas on stage at the end of the challenge. Products and artefacts created during the challenge are also showcased to affirm our students’ innovation.
