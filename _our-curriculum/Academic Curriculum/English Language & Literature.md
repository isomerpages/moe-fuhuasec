### English Language and Literature

**Vision**  <Br>
Confident and future-ready language learners


**Mission**<br>
To develop rational thinkers, confident communicators and cultured youths who appreciate the literary arts

**Approach** <br>
The approach to the teaching and learning of English Language and Literature involves:

1\.  Contextualising an integrated, process-oriented and spiral-progressive curriculum  
    
2\.  Adopting effective learner-centred pedagogies to allow students to become discerning readers and creative inquirers in a language-rich environment  
    
3\.  Providing opportunities for students to be empathetic communicators through learning-focussed interactions   
    

**Key Programmes**

_Multimodality and Multi-literacy_

_Multimodality and Multi-literacy_ (M&M) seeks to develop 21st century competencies (21CC), such as Critical and Inventive Thinking; and Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills in all our students through their learning of English Language and Literature.   
  
_M&M_ learning experiences include:

_IGNITE_

_IGNITE_ stretches the potential of students talented in writing and speaking. It allows accomplished writers to hone their creativity and provides opportunities for them to participate in national and international competitions. Their masterpieces are also encapsulated in the annual in-house publication. Confident speakers will showcase their effective communication skills at school and external platforms.
